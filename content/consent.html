        <b>Protocol: Behavioral study to understand human cognition and attention</b> <br>
        <b>IRB Study Number: IRB19-1242</b>
    </p>
<br>
    <p style="color:black;">
        Welcome! You are invited to participate in a research study investigating human behavior, cognition, and attention. <br>
        The study intends to collect your responses as you complete various types of tasks and/or surveys. <br>

        To help you make an informed decision about whether or not you would like to participate, <br>
        this form provides information about the study’s purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits.<br>
        Please take time to review the consent before starting the experiment. <br>
        If and when you are ready, click on “I consent and accept this HIT”, <br>
        which indicates that you voluntarily accept to participate in the study.<br>
        If you have questions about the experiment in general, <br>
        you may contact the Cognition, Attention, and Brain Lab in University of Chicago Department of Psychology at cablab.uchicago@gmail.com.<br>
        If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, <br>
        you may contact Social & Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at University of Chicago at sbs-irb@uchicago.edu.<br>
    </p>

        <b><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></b> <br>
        This study will help us understand how people pay attention.
    </p>
<br>
    <p style="color:black;">
        <b><u>What will I be doing today, and how long will it take?</u></b> <br>
        During this study, you will see visual stimuli (e.g., images, videos, words, shapes) <br>
        presented on a computer monitor, and/or hear sounds.<br>
        You will respond according to the task instructions. <br>
        You may also be asked to complete questionnaires.<br>
        The length of your participation will be as advertised by the experimenter, <br>
        and you will be compensated at the rate specified for this online study.<br>
        If you decide to withdraw, data collected up until the point of withdrawal may still be included in analysis.<br>
    </p>
<br>
    <p style="color:black;">
        <b><u>What are the potential benefits and risks? </u></b> <br>
        Taking part in this research study may not benefit you personally, <br>
        but we may learn new things that could help others.<br>
        Your participation in this study does not involve any risk to you beyond that of everyday life.<br>
    </p>
<br>
    <p style="color:black;">
        <b><u>Will my personal information remain confidential?</u></b> <br>
        The researchers will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way.<br>
        The survey is therefore anonymous. <br>
        However, your account is associated with an MTurk number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, <br>
        and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched.<br>
        For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles, <br>
        the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous.<br>
    </p>
<br>
    <p style="color:black;">
        <b><u>How will you protect the information you collect about me, and how will that information be shared? </u></b> <br>
        All of your responses will be held in strict confidence. <br>
        Identifiable data will not be stored or shared with other colleagues or funding sources, <br>
        and only the de-identified data will be protected on a secure server.<br>
        De-identified information from this study may be used for future research studies or shared with other researchers or funding sources for future research without your additional informed consent.<br>
